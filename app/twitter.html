		<p>Twitter mood monitor is a graphic user interface which interprets the affective content from Twitter and allows user to access such information via visual representations. It was one of fun projects which ended up to be my master gruaduation project.  </p>

		<div class = "chapter">
			
			<p>I did some research about the popular sentiment analysis approaches at that time. I chose to go for the affective dimensions. It was developed originally for the purpose of self-report emotion measurement. Psychologists can map out similar emotional experiences, which allow a visual depiction of the "emotional distance" between experiences. The emotional experiences are divided into two dimensions known as valences (how negative or positive the experience was) and arousal (extent of reaction to stimuli). I was lucky enough to get the raw data from the affective dimensions therefore this project was initiated. </p>
