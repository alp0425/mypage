		<p>The Roskilde Festival was hosting an innovation project during 2010-2011. The objective was to enhancing innovation of Denmark. Our project “Twistencer” was luckily chosen as one of the 8 innovation projects. We finished this project in 4 months from the concept design to the 3 working prototypes. We were having quite a few crazy deadlines, but I had great  fun for making this project.</p>

			<p>Twistenser is an interactive sound installation that was inspired by Twister (the board game) and sequencer (The electronic musical instrument). Music and board games are both great icebreaker at social event. Therefore we believe the Twistenser will bring people together on the Roskilde Festival.</p>
